Credit Card Fraud Prediction using IBM Auto AI

# Project description
This project discusses building a system for creating predictions that can be used in different scenarios. It focuses on predicting fraudulent transactions, which can reduce monetary loss and risk mitigation. This project aims at building a web App which automatically estimates if there is a fraud risk by taking the input values. Using IBM AutoAI, we automate all of the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. You create a model from a data set that includes the gender, married, dependents, education, self employed, applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, housing and locality.
